ADDING DUETS: THE GAME: THE MOVIE: THE GUIDE

All duet characters are managed using the chart editor accessed by hitting 7 during a song.

In the Char tab:
Click Add or Remove to add or remove a character that you want to sing with bf.
The Duet Char column is the internal name of the character. (so make sure you know that)
Offset X/Y is how much the character is offset from bf. Positive X is right, positive Y is down.
You'll probably need to do a lot of offset tweaking in large increments to get the result you want.

In the Note tab:
When a note is selected, you can click Add or Remove to *toggle* the state of a character.
(If a note isn't selected the game will crash so make sure it's selected)
If they're disabled, they will do an idle animation as opposed to singing.
All characters start disabled.
The toggle is inclusive to the note, meaning that the toggle will affect them on that note, not after.
Put "player" to toggle the player character's singing animations.

In the Song tab:
BF Cam Offset X/Y will change the position of the camera when it's focused on BF. This can be used to
get a better frame of all the duet characters. Try to use small adjustments, especially in the X direction,
as the stage bounds are not super big.
