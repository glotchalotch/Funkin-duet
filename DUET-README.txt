ADDING DUETS: THE GAME: THE MOVIE: THE GUIDE

All duet characters are managed using the chart editor accessed by hitting 7 during a song.

In the Char tab:
- Click Add or Remove to add or remove a character that you want to sing with bf or with the opponent.
- The BF Duet/Enemy Duet column is the internal name of the character. (so make sure you know that)
- Offset X/Y is how much the character is offset from bf or the enemy. Positive X is right, positive Y is down.
  - You'll probably need to do a lot of offset tweaking in large increments to get the result you want.
- "Sync" determines whether they will sing along with or separately from BF (referred to henceforth as
  "synchronous" or "asynchronous"). If they're not, they will have to be charted separately.
- "Main Chart" will bring you back to the original chart after charting for an asynchronous character.

ASYNCHRONOUS CHARACTERS: THINGS TO KNOW:
- When charting async characters, *CHART FOR THE CORRECT SIDE.*
- If they're on bf's side, chart on bf's side and vice versa.
- There is also only one chart PER CHARACTER NAME, so don't freak out if you have the same character on
  different sides and have to edit the same chart for both of them.
- In the section tab, in addition to copying the last section, you can also copy sections from the main
  chart or from another character's chart.

In the Note tab (all of this affects SYNCHRONOUS characters only):
- When a note is selected, you can click Add or Remove to *toggle* the state of a character.
  (If a note isn't selected the game will crash so make sure it's selected. The only way to select a note
  at this time is to add a new one or re-add an old one.)
- If they're disabled, they will do an idle animation as opposed to singing.
- All characters start disabled apart from bf and the enemy.
- The toggle is inclusive to the note, meaning that the toggle will affect them on that note, not after.
- The toggle is also sided, meaning that if the character you want to toggle is on bf's side you need to
  use a note on his side, and vice versa.
- Put "player" to toggle the player (or enemy) character's singing animations.

In the Song tab:
- BF or Enemy Cam Offset X/Y will change the position of the camera when it's focused on BF or the opponent. This can be used to
  get a better view of all the duet characters. Try to use small adjustments, especially in the X direction,
  as the stage bounds are not super big.
